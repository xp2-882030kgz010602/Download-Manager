not arrangements. To make things easier, here is the list of my
original compositions in this download manager:
School Mourn (1b), Scarlet Rhapsody (1d)
Etudes 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/7, 1/8, 1/10

I reserve the right to change this document whenever I want.

UPDATED 4/4/2020:
In short, I have removed some of the ambiguity from this document.

Unlike most terms of use documents, which are intentionally filled
with legal jargon in an attempt to make you just accept them
instead of actually reading them, I have tried to make 
this document as transparent as possible.
1. If you use any part of my compositions in one of your works,
   then you are required to do the following:
 1. Provide a download to your work, for free. No download keys
    can be required to download your work. The download MUST include
    a MIDI (.mid) or MuseScore (.mscz) file of your work.
    The download can be compressed, but the archive must not be
    password-protected and it must be a zip (.zip), 7z (.7z),
    or rar (.rar) archive. Other formats can be included in addition
    to the required MIDI or MuseScore file, and both a MIDI and
    MuseScore file can be part of the download.
 2. Attach an unmodified copy of this document to the download.
2. Do not pass off my compositions as your own.
3. The latest version of this terms of use document takes precedence
   over earlier versions of this terms of use document.
