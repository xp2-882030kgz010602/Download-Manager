This terms of use document only applies to my original compositions,
not arrangements. To make things easier, here is the list of my
original compositions in this download manager:
School Mourn, Scarlet Rhapsody

I reserve the right to change this document whenever I want.

DOCUMENT STARTS HERE

Unlike most terms of use documents, which are intentionally filled
with legal jargon in an attempt to make you just accept them
instead of actually reading them, I have tried to make 
this document as transparent as possible.
1. If you use any part of my compositions in one of your works,
then you are required to do the following:
 1. Provide a download to your work, free of charge. It must not be
 obsfucated, and if that work is a piece of music, to provide the
 download in a format that preserves all note data. In addition, there
 cannot be a download key that is required to download the work (like
 in some bowlroll files). What does this mean?
  1. An example of obsfucation would be a password-protected archive.
  No extra work (other than archive extraction) should be required to
  open the download files. Use a well-known archive format, such as
  zip, rar, or 7z.
  1. An example of a format that preserves all note data would be
  a MIDI or MSCZ file. MP3 does not preserve all note data, it only
  contains audio data.
 2. Attach an unmodified copy of this document to the download.
2. Do not pass off my compositions as your own.
3. The latest version of this terms of use document takes precedence
 over earlier versions of this terms of use document.
